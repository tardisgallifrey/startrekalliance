<h1>Star Trek Alliance game helper app</h1>

<p>I received a game at Christmas called Star Trek Alliance. It is a miniatures strategy game based on Star Wars: X Wing game.  These are both <a href="https://fantasyflightgames.com">from Fantasy Flight Games</a>.</p>

<p>Recently set up the game to play for the first time.  I like the detailed nature of the game and it's open play, but the turn-of-play is rather complicated.  Very straightfoward, but also complicated.  I find myself not keeping things in the proper order.  So, I thought this might be a good idea for a first Java project.  And, this is it.</p>

<p>It's still under major construction.  I'm going further than just a simple step minder.  I'm adding in ship classes, captain classes, die rolls, and other things I can think of.  However, as a simple step minder, it works pretty good so far.</p>

<p>I have it set up as a Maven folder structure, but it uses CLI steps for compile and jar file building.  Those are included.  You can also check out the <code>bash</code> script repo I built to automate building this kind of Java project at

<h3>Lots to do here.  Keep checking back.</h3>
